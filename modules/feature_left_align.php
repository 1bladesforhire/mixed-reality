Inside-out tracking is built into your headset to deliver precise movement fidelity with no need to install hardware on your walls. Spatial audio lets you hear sounds from specific locations just like in the real world, and your advanced motion controller makes it easy to move through virtual spaces. The combined effect is a sensation where your virtual and physical worlds are in perfect sync.</p>
